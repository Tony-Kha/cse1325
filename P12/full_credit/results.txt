QUESTION 1: Which values of width, height, and icount did you select for your machine to generate a Mandelbrot image with 1 thread with around a 30 second runtime: 
            
            Answer: 1500 1500 500

QUESTION 2: Provide the output of ``time ./mandelbrot `` *width height icount nthreads* for runs with 1 through 16 threads below. You can run all of these with a single bash command if you like: ``for i in {1..16} ; do time ./mandelbrot 2000 2000 500 $i ; done``

Example Timing:

  width: 2000  height: 2000  icount: 500  threads: 1
  wrote: image.ppm

real	0m28.751s
user	0m28.715s
sys	0m0.020s


YOUR Timing:
real    1m2.957s
user    1m2.815s
sys     0m0.092s

QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?

    Answer: For the most part it will speed up. However, there is a way for threads to slow down a program and that's if you add too many threads. Example, having 1 core but using 50 threads.


QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?
    
    Answer: Yes because multiple things would be running. For the program to work faster, there would have to be an increase in the load average.
